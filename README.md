## Get Rusty

Let's get rusty ! In this repo there'll be different, practical projects written with Rust and show the possiblities of what Rust can do.

## available run command

`RUSTFLAGS=-Awarnings cargo run --target-dir /data2/rust-target/ -- https://www.rust-lang.org`

- `RUSTFLAGS=-Awarnings cargo run` to suppress warnings


## debugging

Both UI vscode-gdb debugging and rust-lldb commandline debugging are good.
